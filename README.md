# Drone-Vertical-Wind-Profiling

## ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS, STILL COLLECTING LOG DATA BEFORE REFINING MODELS. ⚠️

A project to reverse-engineer consumer drone telemetry (DJI Fly Mavic Mini) to create "Vertical Wind Profiles" based on different low-level altitudes (regression). Additionally, testing out whether the pitch/roll data from the drone's gyroscope (in addition to wind data from OpenWeatherMap can accurately predict what altitude the drone is hovering at (classification).
